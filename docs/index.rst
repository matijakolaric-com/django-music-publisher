**DMP** (Django-Music-Publisher) is open-source music catalogue management software for

* **management of music metadata**, 
* **registration of musical works**, 
* **royalty statement processing**, and
* **basic data distribution**.

DMP will work for most *small* publishers world-wide, but it does not try to solve first-world problems 
(e.g. US PRO rules) for free. See :doc:`Features and Limitations <features>`. 


Based on Django web framework, DMP is primarily designed to be deployed to a cloud, but it can be installed to a personal computer.
(Linux, Mac OS or Windows). See :doc:`Installation <installation>` for details.
