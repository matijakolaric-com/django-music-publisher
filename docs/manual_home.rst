   Home view for superusers

The ``home view`` will show up after a succesfull login, in this example, it is the view superusers see. Depending on permissions, users will see only a subset of the options present here.

In the header, the left part shows the name of the (main) publisher, and the right has the name of the current user as well as links for changing the password and logging out. This header is present in all views.

We have two colums, the left one shows the list of apps and modules, with links to change and add views. The right one shows the last 10 actions of the current user. It is empty, as we have not done anything yet.
