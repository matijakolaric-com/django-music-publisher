User Manual
############

This is the user manual for Django Music Publisher (|release|), regardless if you installed it yourself or through a specialized platform-as-a-service provider for Django Music Publisher instances, e.g. `DMP Guru <https://dmp.guru>`_.

This manual continues at the point where :ref:`StandaloneDeployment` ended, presuming that Django Music Publisher was installed, migrations performed, a superuser created, predefined permission groups added, and that Django Music Publisher is running.

It presumes that the user understands the music industry terms and has already used some web-based tools.
