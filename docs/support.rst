Support
=================================

No individual support is available for Django-Music-Publisher (DMP), which is usual for open-source projects.
As many music publishers are unfamiliar with this concept, an explanation is due here.

Creator of this software is not the vendor for your instance of DMP.

If you run into an issue with any third party, most notably a CMO or their administrative agency, and they tell you to 
ask your software vendor for support, that would be you. 

If you forget your password and have to reset it, there is no one who can do it but you.

If you have any issues whatsoever, solving them is solely your responsibility.

Having said that, here is what you should do.

Documentation
---------------------------------

The first step in resolving any issues should be reading the relevant parts of this documentation, most notably the
:doc:`user manual <manual>`. If you are not sure what is relevant, use search. If it does not help, read everything.

Videos
-------------------------------

Go to :doc:`Videos <videos>` and watch the series about DMP.

Questions and Discussions
---------------------------------

If you still don't know how to resolve the issue, you should try asking in the Facebook Group 
`Music Publisher Support <https://www.facebook.com/groups/musicpublishersupport>`_. Before you do, search the group 
for similar questions. 

Alternatevelly, you can do it in `Discussions <https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/discussions>`_ within the code repository.

Bug and Feature Requests
----------------------------------

If you believe you have encountered a bug in DMP, you can search
through `issues <https://github.com/matijakolaric-com/django-music-publisher/issues>`_, or raise a new one.

How can you be sure if it is a bug? Here are some rules.

Bug
+++

If you repeatedly encounter *500 Server Error*, it is a bug. Please report it. All such bugs are usually fixed within a 
week. Make sure you are following the thread, so you know when the bug is fixed. You still need to update your DMP
instance yourself.

Not a bug
+++++++++

If you see errors, that are incomprehensible to you, during data imports or acknowledgement imports, this is not a bug.
You can still report it as issue, but that will not help you in short term. Creator of DMP might make the 
error more comprehensible in one of the next versions, but don't count on it.

Unlikely a bug
++++++++++++++

If things work, but not the way you would like, that is probably not a bug. You can still raise an issue, and it will
be investigated. However, if it is not a bug, it might be rejected without an explanation.

Upgrade to Commercial
+++++++++++++++++++++

`That Green Thing <https://matijakolaric.com/thatgreenthing>`_ is the commercial upgrade to DMP. It has many more
features and comes with professional support.
